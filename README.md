# Limit Comments By Role

This plugin makes it so that users can only see comments by other users with the same role. Admins can see all comments and all roles can see Admin comments.

This affects all CPT's and the WordPress admin.

Now why is this useful you ask? Well on a standard WordPress site it's probably not that useful. But on a membership site where you are mapping roles and want to limit visibility of comments then it's really useful.

The same basic code can be used to limit comments by ZIPCODE or really any other item you want to compare.
